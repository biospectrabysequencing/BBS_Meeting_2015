## Pull Requests

When you have made a contribution in your  fork and would like it to be included
in  the  original  source repository  you  need  to  notify  the owner  of  that
repository and share the changeset  (your changes packaged in differences form).
This is known as creating a **pull request**.

This is  a simple task  to create a  pull request and  opens up your  changes to
review  and critique.  This  takes the  form  of  a discussion  as  can be  seen
[here](//github.com/PlantandFoodResearch/PFRdataCraft/pull/1).  This  discussion
may  result in  a merging  of the  changes into  the source  repository or  some
suggestions on  how to  improve the  changes so  that they  are merged.   A pull
request can also be closed without merging.

If  a pull  request  requires revision  before  it will  be  merged the  changes
required  can  be  committed to  the  same  branch  and  the pull  request  will
automatically update.  For this  reason it can be useful to  create a branch for
each  specific   piece  of  work  that   will  be  contributed  to   the  source
repository. It is especially important if  you are working on multiple pieces of
work at  the same  time. Having  one pull request  hold up  the work  on another
piece of work can be less than optimal.
